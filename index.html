        <h4>About me</h4>
        <p>
          Being a designer can be kind of tricky to explain. 
        </p>
        <p>
         This portfolio is currently my best attempt to pool together the knowledge and experience gained by exploring many areas of design. 
        </p>
        <p>
          To me, design is as much about asking the crucial questions as it is about getting in and making something. This dual thinking / doing nature is what makes design so interesting to me. While I’m greatly concerned with visual aesthetic, I’m equally as eager to dive deep into some serious technical learning.
        </p>
        <p>
          For these reasons, my practice has led me to develop skills as a design generalist, proficient front end developer, and all-round technical person. I love combining many different disciplines into meaningful designs. 
        </p>
        <p>
          This added perspective gives me an edge in bridging the gap between an idea and a real product. For example, if I’m creating a web layout, my extensive experience with HTML and CSS, and recent Javascript learning, means I know how that design is likely to be translated into something that works in a web browser.
